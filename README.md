# Earthstar Pub

Hosts and syncs [Earthstar](https://github.com/cinnamon-bun/earthstar) workspaces over HTTP.  One pub server can hold multiple Earthstar workspaces.

You can
* View the data through a web interface
* Sync your local files to/from the server using [earthstar-cli](https://github.com/cinnamon-bun/earthstar-cli/)

Pub servers don't sync directly to each other (yet?).

## Caveats

This is for demonstration purposes, so it shows all the workspaces and data over the web.  Normally Earthstar pubs should not reveal which workspaces they hold.

It stores data in memory, not on disk, so it will forget everything if restarted.  Note that glitch.com restarts projects often.

There's an [issue](https://github.com/earthstar-project/earthstar-pub/issues/1) describing how to store data in SQLite for persistence.

## Running on Glitch

Make your own copy on Glitch by going [here](https://glitch.com/~earthstar-demo-pub-v5-a) and clicking "Remix this".

Or start a new Glitch project from scratch:

* Make a new Express project
* Go to Glitch's `package.json`, click "Add package", and add `earthstar-pub`
* Delete the demo code from `server.js`
* Copy-paste the code from this repo's [`example.js`](https://github.com/earthstar-project/earthstar-pub/blob/master/example.js) into Glitch's `server.js`
* Rename your project, at the top left
* Click "ðŸ•¶ Show > In a New Window" to visit your pub
